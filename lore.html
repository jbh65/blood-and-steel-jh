        The year is 1925.<br> It has been seven years since the major world powers declared
        ceasefire.<br> Over the skies of Moscow nobody was sure who had won.<br> From where we
        stood all had lost.

        At the 11<sup>th</sup> hour of the 11<sup>th</sup> day of the 11<sup>th</sup> month of 1918 the bombs stopped
        falling, and the guns fell silent.  The Empire of Britannia stood in ruins
        slightly less ruinous than all her neighbours and a pyrrhic victory was declared.
        Her citizens were reassured that the mighty phoenix would re-emerge from the
        ashes of Europa.

        Instead we returned slowly to our homes. Seven years. Seven years to cross the
        Balkans and Gaul, slowly licking our wounds. We had won the day, but at what
        cost? Friends had died, drowning in mud, amidst the stench of war. And for what?
        For colonies we had never seen? For lands we would never own. For years we had
        dreamt of our loved ones and our homes, we were young when we arrived at the
        line but older than we could imagine when we left it. We thought we would be
        home any day. Any day this madness would stop. Any day the ships would arrive
        to carry us back home. But they never came, instead word was passed down the
        line that it was over, that it was done, that we didn’t have to fight anymore.
        And so the slow march began. And again friends lost their lives – not to the
        guns of the enemy, not to an explosive blast in the night, but to starvation,
        to thirst and to the cold.

        I arrived home, and set my first foot back on the docks at Liverpool. My first
        taste of England, of Britannia, for twenty years. And what I saw I did not
        recognise. I thought maybe I was still on the front, not a building stood
        untouched by the fires of war, and the sky choked on the black black smoke. I
        headed south, catching an iron train across a land I scarcely remembered. I
        could have sworn I remembered green, rolling hills – maybe it was always this
        scarred, pockmarked, wasteland. The cries of the conductor rang out for
        Birmingham and I alighted from the train, making my way down streets that I
        knew only as if I had been there in another life.

        Welcome to the dark city traveller. Once this was a proud place, bustling with
        life, standing at the peak of technology. But now, in the aftermath of The War,
        the city has fallen. For years all that mattered was victory. Total War. The
        city churned out bullet after bullet, bomb after bomb, to feed the war effort.
        Then it all just ended. The ceasefire was called and all was done.
      </p>
      <p class="lore-text">
        The government was completely bankrupt, bailed out only at the behest of the
        great industrialists, the profiteers of war who had built entire empires out of
        the constant grind and churn of battle. Gradually the elites of society
        retreated further away from their subjects. The streets became. The threat of
        zeppelins, bombs and missiles were replaced by the roving gangs of street thugs.
        No police to run to, no government to complain to. It was the new normal.
      </p>
      <p class="lore-text">
        This is the reality that the survivors of the front have returned home to. The
        strong survive and the weak do not. But while they look upon the gangs that rule
        the city’s streets with disdain, it compares only to the disdain they feel for
        the people they prey upon. Was this what they fought for? They look out across
        the city and slowly their anger grows. They fought for these people. They
        watched good men and women die for these people, for these cowards. These
        people deserve to be crushed, to be ruled. But not by those savages, not by
        those youths who have never tasted real battle. No, they deserved to be ruled
        by those who had been forged in the fires of war, who knew the cost of blood
        and steel.
