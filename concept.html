        Welcome to Blood &amp; Steel. We are aiming to build a table top strategy and
        skirmish game, with an emphasis on easy to understand, competitive play – as
        opposed to hefty tomes of rules to lug round with you! We also want to ensure
        that the game is as cheap as possible to get involved with. As such all necessary
        resources will be available to download free of charge; enabling players to
        “print &amp; play” the entire game using their own materials.

        The game is set in a steampunk inspired, alternative post-WW1 England; after
        decades of war cities are in ruins – controlled by ruthless gangs. With the
        arrival home of many who served in the conflict the balance of power is shifting.
        Players take control of one of four factions (more on those later) and battle
        with one another to secure their dominance over the city. The gameplay is
        separated over two maps – the campaign map and the skirmish map. On the
        campaign map players engage in the strategic element; managing their faction’s
        resources and vying with one another for territory. The events on the campaign
        map lead to skirmishes being fought between players, which take place on a hex
        map. At this micro level players engage in gang warfare across the ruined
        terrain of the city – with a focus on small squad tactics. Victories and
        defeats influence control of the city in the overall campaign.

        Our primary focus is on making the rules fairly instinctual. This is not to say
        that we’re trying to dumb-down the genre, it’s just we think a fast paced, fluid
        game can take the onus off skill tables, and put it back onto the
        battlefield – immersing players more in the tactical element of the game.
        The first step here is using a hex based map as the battlefield – we want
        movement to be more natural and quick. Secondly, we are aiming to simplify
        dice roll outcomes. Rather than using complex outcome tables, we use simple
        hit and miss / save and wound dice rolls. A characters skill is instead
        represented through the amount of dice they have available to roll
        (in effect a skilled marksman with a master crafted rifle has more chances
        to hit than a thug with a popgun).

        The game is still in development, and we hope to release a full rulebook along
        with sample game boards and pieces in the near future. But in the meantime we
        are very happy that you have made your way to our homepage – any input we could
        have from players and potential players would be welcomed so feel free to get
        in contact with us.
