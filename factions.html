          The Red Coats
          <p class="faction-text">
            The Redcoats are what remains of the city’s army regiment. Having initially returned
            to their barracks the survivors were horrified to find their wounded comrades uncared
            for, left to beg on the streets.<br><br>
            They quickly reasserted control over the barracks district, in a single night of carnage
            they emerged from their fortress and unleashed
            all of their hard won skills on the gangs in the streets. Striding out
            onto the streets these men and women wear their full dress uniforms onto
            the new battlefield. Torn and patched redcoats, emblazoned with the gold
            stripes of
            ranks that they quickly return to, emboldened by the medals that they wear proudly
            on their chests. As they see it, they are the logical replacement for the crumbled police
            forces that
            have disappeared from the city. If they enjoy the spoils of the war it will take to
            re-establish control over the streets, who will complain?

          The Dockers
          <p class="faction-text">
            The Dockers trace their origins to the five families of the Old City. Irishmen whose
            sweat poured into the cities birth. They earned their place hauling the loads off
            the laden down barges that cruise the main artery of the river, and the veins of
            the canals.<br><br>
            Many sons and daughters left for the war, boarding naval ships instead of trade
            barges, and have spent decades at sea. During the years that they were gone, the
            five families grip over the docks weakened and the South docks broke from the
            North, ruining the monopoly the dockers had held on trade coming in to the city.
            <br><br>
            With young blood returning to the family ranks the five look to reunite the North
            and South banks of the docks. But the new lieutenants look further still, out over
            the rising smoke of the city, they look to the horizon and wonder why the five
            should not rule the whole river and all around.

            The Red Sky Triad
            <p class="faction-text">
              The Red Sky Triad As the City grew in the time before the war it had attracted mass
              immigration from the East. Mothers and Fathers sought better lives for their
              children in the Western land, lured by the promise of plentiful work and
              opportunities for all.
              Their children grew up in the shanty towns of the South East districts, that became
              known as Chinatown – although it’s populous was made up of every colour and creed of
              Britannia’s colonies. Their slums overlooked the great Airworks, and they watched
              with wonder as the first zeppelins launched into the skies.<br><br>
              In time they would come to serve aboard the great airships – flying back East to
              the lands of their parents. Terrible battles were fought in the skies over Asia,
              as the Empire desperately held on to their strongholds in Burma. While stationed
              there the airmen renewed strong family connections and discovered wonderous chemical
              compounds and narcotics that could ease pain and dissolve fear. As free men, set
              loose to care for themselves at the end of the war they hatched plans to solidify
              smuggling routes for their new commodities. They view control of the city as a way
              to a means, a foothold in Britannia from which to establish a cartel with a monopoly
              on the narcotics trade in the homeland.

            The Iron Union
            <p class="regular-text">
              The Iron Union is the only faction not made up of those who served at the front. But
              that is not to say they did not suffer the terrors of war just as those who return
              now. The Union is made up of those who toiled in the city’s foundries – forging the
              instruments of war as the bombs rained down upon them. The enemy saw the blazing
              fires of the major factories as a key target; aiming to disrupt the flow of
              munitions to the war effort. The workers were held back from fighting. Their skills
              too important to risk losing. <br><br>
              As the war closed the Union, that had for so long been nothing more than a loose
              association of workers, supporting one another through the terrors of the bombings,
              was forced to become more. First they united to defend themselves from scrupulous
              industrialists who aimed to reduce these men and women to nothing more than slaves,
              they fought for their rights – wresting control of the factories from the overseers.
              But as the city dissolved into anarchy around them, the Union was needed to provide
              protection. Workers who had stood shoulder to shoulder at the furnaces stood shoulder
              to shoulder against the gangs that sought to extort them, and terrorise their
              families.<br><br>
              Muscle bound arms, used to swinging the heavy hammers at the smithies,
              instead raised weapons against those who sought to do harm to them and their
              loved ones. Now they eye the new arrivals with suspicion. They see the ambition,
              gleaming in the eyes of those who seek control of the city. But these newcomers
              do not see that not all in the city are equal, the Union is strong.
